Created a [Unity game](/projects/hastyhop) that won 3rd place in the 'Individual Junior Technology' category, as well as a special award from Broadcom MASTERS International, where I was brought to Phoenix, Arizona as an opportunity to meet other like minded students and observe the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.
