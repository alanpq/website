Written in a scary mix of Python and JavaScript, steam-notifications provides a replacement for Steam's (not great) notifications by interfacing with dunst.

It communicates with Steam as a standard client using DoctorMcKay's [SteamUser](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user), which allows it to handle and create chat notifications.
