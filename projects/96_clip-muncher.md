Easily browse, search, and share videos uploaded to your Discord servers.

> **NOTE**: Clip Muncher is currently closed source and only active on a handful of private Discord serversâ€”without being in one of them, you will not be able to log in.

### How does it work?

- The Discord bot is added to a server, and a channel assigned as the clip upload channel.
- The bot will then start scraping & downloading all videos uploaded to that channel.
- By logging in to the [site](https://clips.alanp.me) with Discord, you can then browse clips from scraped servers you are in.
- You can search by video name, message text associated with the clip, uploader, or by tagged users.
  - You can only tag featured users in clips you uploaded.
