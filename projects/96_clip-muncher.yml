  <h3>How does it work?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Discord bot is added to a server, and a channel assigned as the clip upload channel.</li>
    <li>The bot will then start scraping & downloading all videos uploaded to that channel.</li>
    <li>By logging in to the <a href="https://clips.alanp.me" target="_blank">site</a> with Discord, you can then browse clips from scraped servers you are in.</li>
    <li>You can search by video name, message text associated with the clip, uploader, or by tagged users.
    <ul><li>You can only tag featured users in clips you uploaded.</li></ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
